    Why Web Aplication ? 
    
    * All web applications are server based & they reside will server consuming all resources of server.
    * We log on to network to access these applications & to installing any software.
    * Web applications are very low in security because they are in public network. USer should explicitly make 
      security arranagments.
    * We bapplications are poor in user interfaces, Graphics & also in performance AS there load is more. 
      and remote previlages for improving these factors are less. Some new technologies like flash, 
      silverlight, CSS is used to make graphics rich.
    * Web Applicatioons are accesible universaly & they are independent of evrything.
    * Web Applications needs to installed on server whereas desktop applications needs to be installed on 
      every computer where we need to access them.
    * Patches, Maintainace and support is easily available.
    * Only browser is required on client machine to acces them.
    * Accesible from anywhere, provided there is internet.
    * Cross platform.

    Why Desktop Applications ?

    * All desktop applications are client based means they reside at client machine & use all resources of 
      client.
    * Desktop applications are more secured than any other type of applications. Most of the dektop 
      applications are programmed without secured code but still they are secured apps.
    * Desktops are rich in graphics and also in performance. because code is local, it can access 
      all the resources like graphics card, additional memory of machine etc..
    * Desktop applications are accssed locally & they are depndent on various factors like OS, 
      hardware, locations etcs..
